\section{Methodological fundamentals}
This chapter
	\subsection{Common Frameworks for Deep Learning Applications}
		- some examples, tensorflow (tensorflow slim -> High  level api for easier use, tensorflow lite), Caffe, Keras, Torch, PyTorch, ... \\
		https://datahub.packtpub.com/deep-learning/top-10-deep-learning-frameworks/ \\
	\subsection{Common Models in Deep Learning Applications}
		- short differences between different architecuteres (?, CNN, RNN) \\
 		- AlexNet, Mobilenet, Inception, VGG, -> short decsription, useCases, important things, differences \\
	\subsection{Qualified Models for mobile App Integration}
 		- Mobilenet, Inception etc -> short decsription, useCases, important things, differences \\
	\subsection{Key requirements for an appropriate dataset}
		- generall why you need a huge dataset -> different backgrounds \\
		- self trained needs a huge dataset, a lot of computing performance and time \\
		-> so use pre trained, if small dataset. \\
		-> pretrained used millions of pictures (e.g. ImageNet)
