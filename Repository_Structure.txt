Important folders:

- code 
	--> Android_apps 
		- DogBreedAnalyzerI with Inception
		- DogBreedAnalyzerM with Mobilnet0.50
	--> scripts: 
		- eval_label-image.sh (script for Evaluating the models)
		- retrain.py (adapted retrain script with time markers and other changes)

- Installation
	--> Installation scripts for installing Tensorflow and Anaconda with CPU or with GPU support

- label_image_pics
	--> pics which were taken to test the models during the optimization

- works
	--> all trained models (folder is named like model_version_trainingSteps)
	In the models folders: 
	Aufschrieben = protocol with executed commands, label_image_learningRate, 			training_history_learningRate

	--> pics from CPU_GPU_usages for comparison

	--> Evaluation: all evaluation documents including measurements
	
	--> final_networks: models and labels which were included in the app

	--> models_trainedOn_imageNet: models which were retrained on ImageNet pics just for research 		purpose

	--> other models: caffe, googlenet etc.
