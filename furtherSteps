retrain again with using a mobilenet Model
maybe the whole thing works with tensorflow for poets

1. https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/#4 - already done

Prepare model for mobile use

Focus on Freeze Graph: Tensorflow Slim
https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/slim#pre-trained-models

Freeze or transform?
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/tools/graph_transforms/#optimizing-for-deployment

Last time:
- retrained image recognition in /tmp/
- tried first tutorial tensorflow for poets - step is missing from up to freeze graph
--> see this step in prepare model (explanation short for python, complete for bazel)
